### Website of Lingle

### Inspiration
 - Being a student we have to read a lot of research paper to learn something new. Being a citizen we read news of different countries, different organizations with the developent of globalization. But with so many articles to read we only have limit time. Therefore, trying to find what is really useful in a short time is really useful for people nowadays.
### Introduction to this project
  - Trying to read news or a research paper but the article is too long to read? Paste the article on the website posted above and Lingle will help you extract the significant sentences in the article, and then it will be much easier for you to read!
#### Basic Functions
 - After pasting the whole article on the dialog box and click on the analyse button, Lingle will show you the significant sentences placed in different categories ( positive attitude, negative attitude and neutral attitude). Then you can now read the text much easier by just looking at the sentences extracted and knowing what kind of attitude these sentences represented.

### Great Features
 - With the sentences being in different categories, users can get the general attitude of the whole article by just skim those sentences.
### How we built it
 - The project is built in python and we also use the Natural Language Machine Learning APIs from Google to analyze the context of the article ( Thanks Google).

### Challenges we ran into
 - We spent some time trying to show the context on the website with python connecting with html, css, Django framework which will show the sentences.

### What we learned
 - We learnt how to use the API and how to create a website.

### What's next
 - Continue to work on it to improve the interface and add more features like adding colour to the sentences in the article to distinguish the categories.
